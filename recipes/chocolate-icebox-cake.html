            <li>Place cream in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract; continue to beat until soft-medium peaks form. Reserve 1 cup of whipped cream and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>

Add a layer of cookies over the cream, breaking any cookies as necessary to fill in any empty spaces; top with 1/4 of remaining cream. Top with another layer of cookies and another 1/4 of remaining cream. Repeat the process two more times until all the cream is used. Top with remaining cookies, pressing them into the cream.</li>
